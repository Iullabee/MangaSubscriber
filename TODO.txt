GOALS :



§§REFACTORING UI



§§FUNCTIONALITIES

- search function to look up mangas on all websites ?

- add button to navigation bar (or list options ? ) to mark chapter as unread

- add a tags {} property to the mangas' structure in mangas_list
-- tags can be defined by the user
-- popup can filter the list by tags (multi select)

- modify searchFor functions to better handle different names on different websites (especially names containing non alphanumerical characters like coma or dots)
-- if it doesnt find any result in the source, ask for new srouce after cutting name in last space



§§OPTIMIZATIONS

- refresh list more often and at the right time
-- refresh individual mangas
-- take into account the page loading time to refresh the mangas when clicking a "read in new tab" button

- add an option to limit how many mangas are displayed at once in the list
-- mangas past that limit are not part of the dom (no element to represent htem), they are created when displaying the next block (and previous block is destroyed)
-- either put in a numerical limit (ex : 200) or pick mangas based on their first letter ( a - b - c - etc)

- look into caching the popup



§§WEBSITES LIST

- support more websites :
-- separate the websites list object from background page for easier maintainability
