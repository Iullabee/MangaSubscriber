GOALS :



§§REFACTORING UI

- actualize help panel



§§FUNCTIONALITIES

- add button to navigation bar (or list options ? ) to mark chapter as unread

- add a follow/ed <a> to the search results



§§OPTIMIZATIONS

- refresh list more often and at the right time
-- refresh individual mangas
-- take into account the page loading time to refresh the mangas when clicking a "read in new tab" button

- add an option to limit how many mangas are displayed at once in the list
-- mangas past that limit are not part of the dom (no element to represent htem), they are created when displaying the next block (and previous block is destroyed)
-- either put in a numerical limit (ex : 200) or pick mangas based on their first letter ( a - b - c - etc)

- look into caching the popup
-- maybe create the html (at list the list part) in the background and serve it to the popup



§§WEBSITES LIST

- support more websites :
-- separate the websites list object from background page for easier maintainability
