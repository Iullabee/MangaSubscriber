GOALS :



§§REFACTORING UI

- migrate help to the popup:
-- panels appearing on top of the list when their buttons are clicked
-- "slide over" animation
-- redo help page as panel and add css and javascript



§§FUNCTIONALITIES

- change the way users choose websites to update on :
-- instead of a "preferred website" select and a "check all sites" toggle, create a multiple choice "websites" select (containing a "all" and a "none" line) for each website, search the manga name and show the result to the user so he can select it even if it's a different name
-- store those preferences in each manga (in a object, with website name as key and manga root url as data)
-- global assign/unassign in the "apply to all mangas" line
-- get rid of selectors in websites structure and use manga root for that website when updating

- autoupdate function :
-- choose interval in hours
-- 0 = never

- search function to look up mangas on all websites ? :
-- create a search function in each website object (could be used when updating in case a manga has different name on different sites?)



§§WEBSITES LIST

- support more websites :
-- separate the websites list object from background page for easier maintainability
