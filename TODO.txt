GOALS :



§§REFACTORING UI

- merge popup and options mangas lists in the popup :
-- a [+] button unfolding additional options buttons OR a vertical div on the right side containing the buttons (only the ones for the hovered/selected manga being displayed)
-- changing the "search" field to filter
-- add an "apply to all visible mangas" line at the start of the list, with update now, mark all chapters as read, update toggle, delete buttons)
-- add a confirmation panel to delete a manga ("deleting <br> [TITLE HERE] <br> yes / no")
-- redo icons for more explicit/standard ones (ex : "delete" -> trashcan icon)

- merge menu and list panels :
-- replace menu buttons by icons (ex : options -> cogwheel/wrench icon)
-- horizontal menu at the top (always visible)

- migrate options and help to the poup:
-- panels appearing on top of the list when their buttons are clicked
-- "slide over" animation



§§FUNCTIONALITIES

- change the way users choose websites to update on :
-- instead of a "preferred website" select and a "check all sites" toggle, create a multiple choice "websites" select (containing a "all" and a "none" line)
-- store those preferences in each manga
-- global assign/unassign in the "apply to all mangas" line

- autoupdate function :
-- choose interval in hours
-- 0 = never

- search function to look up mangas on all websites ? :
-- create a search function in each website object (could be used when updating in case a manga has different name on different sites?)



§§WEBSITES LIST

- support more websites :
-- separate the websites list object from background page for easier maintainability
