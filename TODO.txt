GOALS :



§§REFACTORING UI

- migrate help to the popup :
-- redo help page as panel and add css and javascript

- change the way the modal window works (make it more generic)
-- pass title and content along with callback on agree when it is revealed



§§FUNCTIONALITIES

- change the way users choose websites to update on :
-- instead of a "preferred website" select and a "check all sites" toggle, create a multiple choice "websites" select (containing a "all" and a "none" line) for each website, search the manga name and show the result to the user so he can select it even if it's a different name
-- store those preferences in each manga (in a object, with website name as key and manga root url as data)
-- global assign/unassign in the "apply to all mangas" line
-- get rid of selectors in websites structure and use manga root for that website when updating

- search function to look up mangas on all websites ? :
-- create a search function in each website object (could be used when updating in case a manga has different name on different sites?)



§§OPTIMIZATIONS

- avoid excessive storage access
-- store mangas list in general scope variable in background script, and save it to storage each time it is modified, but all access are to be done on the variable
-- initialize mangas list variable after calling db_update



§§WEBSITES LIST

- support more websites :
-- separate the websites list object from background page for easier maintainability
