GOALS :



§§REFACTORING UI



§§FUNCTIONALITIES

- change the way users choose websites to update on :
-- get rid of selectors in websites structure and use manga root for that website when updating
-- change background.updateMangasList to use mangas_list[name]["registered_websites"]

- search function to look up mangas on all websites ? :
-- create a search function in each website object (could be used when updating in case a manga has different name on different sites?)

- add button to navigation bar (or list options ? ) to mark chapter as unread



§§OPTIMIZATIONS

- refresh list more often and at the right time
-- refresh individual mangas
-- take into account the page loading time to refresh the mangas when clicking a "read in new tab" button

- add an option to limit how many mangas are displayed at once in the list
-- mangas past that limit are not part of the dom (no element to represent htem), they are created when displaying the next block (and previous block is destroyed)
-- either put in a numerical limit (ex : 200) or pick mangas based on their first letter ( a - b - c - etc)

- look into caching the popup



§§WEBSITES LIST

- support more websites :
-- separate the websites list object from background page for easier maintainability
